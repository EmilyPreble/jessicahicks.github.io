<p>I'm so excited that you are here! I am a sophomore at Lehigh University studying journalism and communications and political science. I also have interests in marketing and sociology. Here is where I am keeping my ventures in the world of data visualization. Scholars at Standford posed the significant question, "how do we (journalists) communicate with data, how can traditional narratives be fused with sophisticated, interactive information displays?" In order to find my own answer to this question, I enrolled in a visual communications class. Here is what I was able to accomplish in a short seven weeks.</p>

<a id="My work in visual communication" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My work</h3>

<p>I was born a storyteller. From the time I could read and write, I spent every spare moment putting my ideas and experiences into words. At first, using graphs, charts, maps and illustrations to tell a story inimidated me. I quickly got over this fear, and using various online tools, was able to create visualizations that tell stories about my interests and life on campus.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wondered if Lehigh is rightfully deemed a school for engineers, and created an <a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/engineers.html">infographic</a> to highlight a dataset.</p>
<li><p>My love for music led me to create a <a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/concerts.html"> map</a> of the concert venues I've been to.</p>
<li><p>I am a news editor for Lehigh's biweekly newspaper,<i>The Brown and White</i>. I questioned the history of the publication, so I constructed a<a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/brownandwhite.html"> timeline</a> to share its fascinating past.</p>
<li><p>As a member of the College of Arts and Sciences, I was interested when I had to make a <a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/percentenrollment.html"> chart</a> showing enrollment from 2006-15.</p>
<li><p>Tableau proved to be an extremely helpful tool this past semester. I used the application to make a wide variety of visualizations, including this <a href="jessicahicks.github.io/arrests.html">interactive barchart</a> to show arrests on local college campuses.</p>
<li><p>I realized the importance of illustration in communication, and created a comic using Pixton, shown below</p>
